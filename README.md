# SAS
LIU Yuanyuan, TUT, 2021-06-01.
This project is to extract speech attribute score (SAS) features for Parkinson's disease (PD) assessment. Commonly used features eGeMAPS and MFCC are used as baselines.
SAS features are extracted using MULAN-ACCENT implemented in Kaldi (https://github.com/Vanova/MULAN-ACCENT).
Our method was validated on a Finnish PD corpuse (PDSTU) and a Spanish PD corpus (PC-GITA). The predictions of speech/voice disorders, speech intelligibility, overall severity of communication disorder, UPDRS and UPDRS-speech are formed as regression problems.
